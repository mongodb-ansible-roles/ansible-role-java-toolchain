Explanation
-----------

This role will use the `/opt/java/toolchain_version` file to determine whether to install a new toolchain or not.

The `/opt/java/toolchain_version` file will be created by this role with the user specified `java_toolchain_sha` as its contents.

The `/opt/java/toolchain_version` file only shows the latest toolchain that was installed on the host. It does not have any record of older toolchain installations.

If the version file and `java_toolchain_sha` match, the toolchain will not be downloaded.

If the versions don't match, the new toolchain will be downloaded to the `/tmp` directory and then moved into the `/opt/java/revisions` directory. From there, the toolchain installation script is run.

This role will delete existing java toolchains if the version specified doesn't match.

Exception for PPC and s390x
---------------------------

The strategy for the Java toolchain on PPC and s390x is different than x86_64 and aarm64 machines.
Oracle does not offer a packages JDK for these platforms. Instead, we install Java through the system package manager and then create a "fake" Java toolchain at `/opt/java`. The jdk, usually jdk8, is then symlinked to that location from `/etc/alternatives/java_sdk_1.8.0` to `/opt/java/jdk8`. This is needed to run ant.
